This program was created in Ruby following the Odin Project curriculum.

caeser_cipher is a simple program to replicate the Caeser Cipher, where a message is passed along with a shift key, and an ecnrypted version is returned by shifting each letter forward in the alphabet according to the key. Capitalization should remain the same, and punctuation should be ignored.
